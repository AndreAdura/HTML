<h1 id="am">About Me</h1>


<img src="gaming.jpg" height="420px" width="640px">
<p>
	I'm a Brazilian guy who is passionate by arts in general, amateur musician, books lover and cinephile. After my entire life working with International Trade, lectures and sales I decided to run after my dream to do what I love, create the ultimate form of art ever made, GAMES!
</p>
<p>
	After that tough decision I started my studies in Brazil as Digital Design at SAGA School of Arts, learning a little bit of image treatment, vectorial images, 3D modeling, visual script and concept art for games, meanwhile I still worked as a International trade Analyst.
</p>

<p>
	When I first opened my eyes for all possibilities and elements involved in a game I realized that I need the proper knowledge to put all this forms of art together and there is only one way to do this, CODING!
	And that's how I ended here in Canada doing my best to improve my habilities to finally reach my dream to work in the games industry.
